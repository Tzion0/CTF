When am I??

So, I look down at my watch. It's December 28, 2011 at 11:59AM, and I'm just minding my own business at -13.582075733990298, -172.5084838587106.
I hung out there until the local time was 1:00AM on December 31st, and then I hopped on a plane and took a 1 hour flight over to -14.327595989244111, -170.71287979386747.
Some time has passed since I landed, and on December 30th, 12PM local time, I took a 1 hour flight back to my original location.
It's been 10 hours since I landed on my most recent flight - how many seconds have passed since I first looked at my watch?
